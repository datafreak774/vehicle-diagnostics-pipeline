# 🚗 Vehicle Diagnostics Pipeline

> Real-time vehicle health monitoring and failure prediction system using streaming data.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This ongoing project simulates and processes real-time vehicle diagnostics data (synthetic data) using a modern big data stack. The goal is to build an end-to-end pipeline for real-time ingestion, processing, storage, and analytics of automotive health metrics — enabling proactive fault detection and predictive maintenance.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack (Planned)

- **Apache Kafka** – Data ingestion (Docker, Bitnami images)
- **Spark Streaming (PySpark)** – Real-time processing
- **Databricks / Local Spark** – Data engineering and ML model deployment
- **MinIO (S3-compatible)** – Object storage (data lake)
- **PostgreSQL** – Metadata and processed results storage
- **Apache Airflow** – Orchestration of data pipelines
- **Power BI / Plotly Dash** – Visualization of vehicle health & failure predictions
- **ML Models** – Anomaly detection & failure prediction from diagnostics data

## 🧱 Planned Architecture
[Kafka Producer] --> [Kafka Broker] --> [Spark Streaming (PySpark)] --> [MinIO Data Lake] --> [ML Model] --> [PostgreSQL] --> [Dashboard (Power BI / Dash)] ↘ [Airflow ETL Pipelines]


## 🚧 Current Status

> Project under development. Environment setup and initial data simulation in progress.

## 📌 Goals

- Simulate real-world diagnostics data streams
- Build scalable data pipeline using Spark + Kafka
- Train ML model to detect failures based on streaming data
- Store outputs in PostgreSQL, orchestrated via Airflow
- Deploy interactive dashboard for visualization
